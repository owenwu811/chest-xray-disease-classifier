## Dataset

This project uses the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Due to the large size of the image files, they are not included in this repository.

ðŸ‘‰ You can download the full dataset from the official source:

Place the extracted images in a directory called `images/` at the root level to run the notebook.
